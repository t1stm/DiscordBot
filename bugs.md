Hello this is the new bug file. :D 

I will enter in bugs here and their dates.

Created on the 1st April 2022

Bugs: 

1. **Bug found on the 3 April 04:37**: For some reason the YouTube thumbnails aren't saved with the highest quality, probably something with the Search client.
2. ~~New Serializer Doesn't work at all: Saves all types as Discord-Attachments and Duplicates ASCII letters.~~
